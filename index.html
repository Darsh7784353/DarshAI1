	"what is height of flying plane": "Planes fly at different heights, but most commercial airliners cruise between 30,000 to 42,000 feet (9-13 km), above most weather, for better fuel efficiency in thinner air. Small planes fly lower (10,000-15,000 ft).",
        "what is hydrogen": "Hydrogen (H) is the lightest, simplest, and most abundant chemical element, forming colorless, odorless, flammable gas (\(H_{2}\)) under normal conditions, acting as a crucial building block in water, organic matter, and stars, and growing as a clean energy carrier for future power. ",
        "what is helium": "Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert gas, the second lightest element, and second most abundant in the universe after hydrogen, known for its extremely low boiling point, used in balloons, MRI machines, and rocket fuel due to its inertness and low density. Formed during the Big Bang and by nuclear fusion in stars, it's extracted from natural gas and is crucial for cryogenics and protecting welds, despite being a finite resource on Earth. ",
        "how petrol is made": "Petrol (gasoline) is made by refining crude oil, a natural fossil fuel, through a process called fractional distillation, where heated crude oil separates into different components like petrol in distillation towers based on their boiling points. Further chemical processes, like catalytic cracking, purify and blend additives to boost performance, resulting in the fuel that powers cars. ",
        "how diesel is made": "Diesel fuel is primarily made from crude oil through fractional distillation, a process where heated oil vaporizes and separates into different products in a distillation tower based on boiling points, with diesel (a heavier fraction) collected at intermediate levels, followed by purification and blending to meet quality standards, often involving sulfur removal. Biomass-based diesel (biodiesel) is also produced from vegetable oils or animal fats, offering a renewable alternative. ",
        "what is petrol": "Petrol (or gasoline) is a clear, flammable liquid derived from crude oil, primarily used as fuel for spark-ignition internal combustion engines in cars and other light vehicles, composed of various hydrocarbons (like butane, isopentane) with additives to improve performance, and is known for its high energy density but also its environmental impact. ",
        "what is diesel": "Diesel is a combustible liquid fuel made from crude oil or biomass, primarily used in compression-ignition engines (diesel engines) found in trucks, buses, trains, ships, and some cars, known for its high energy density, powering heavy-duty transport, construction equipment, and backup generators. It's characterized by hydrocarbon composition and ignition properties, igniting from heat rather than a spark plug, offering better fuel economy but traditionally producing more particulate pollutants than gasoline. ",
        "which fuel does plane use": "Aeroplanes primarily use Jet Fuel (a kerosene-based fuel like Jet A-1) for turbine engines (commercial jets/turboprops) or Aviation Gasoline (AVGAS) for smaller, piston-engine aircraft, with Jet A-1 being the most common globally for large planes due to its stability and performance at high altitudes. Jet fuel is a refined petroleum product with specific additives for safety and engine protection, while AVGAS is a specialized gasoline for smaller planes. ",
        "what is e20 fuel": "E20 fuel is a blend of 20% ethanol (a renewable biofuel from plants like sugarcane/corn) and 80% gasoline (petrol), designed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, cut emissions (like carbon monoxide), and boost energy security, especially in countries like India. While it offers environmental benefits and higher octane, its lower energy density can slightly decrease fuel efficiency (mileage), but newer vehicles (from around 2009/2010 onwards in India) are generally E20 compatible, with some older models potentially needing minor upgrades. ",
        "how planes are made": "Planes are made by first designing them with advanced software, then manufacturing thousands of individual parts from materials like aluminum, titanium, and lightweight composites (carbon fiber). These components (fuselage, wings, tail, engines) are built by various companies, then brought to a main assembly plant for final joining, followed by rigorous installation of systems (avionics, electrical) and extensive ground and flight testing for safety and performance. ",
        "how f1 cars are made": "F1 cars are made through a complex, year-long process of design (CAD/CFD), simulation, and extensive testing, culminating in manufacturing over 14,000 components, primarily from lightweight carbon fiber composites cured in autoclaves, with metal parts precision-machined, all built to strict FIA regulations for performance and safety, requiring a massive, specialized team effort. ",
        "how electricity is generated": "Electricity is generated by converting mechanical energy (spinning motion) into electrical energy, usually by spinning a turbine connected to a generator; this motion comes from steam (from burning fossil fuels, nuclear fission, geothermal, or solar thermal), moving water (hydro), or wind, while solar panels use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight directly, with all methods ultimately using magnets and coils of wire to induce an electric current.

 	"why titanic ship sank": "The Titanic sank because it struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage, breaching at least five of its sixteen watertight compartments, exceeding its design limit (four compartments), which caused progressive flooding and eventual sinking in under three hours on April 15, 1912. Contributing factors included the ship traveling too fast in icy waters, potential issues with steel quality and weak rivets, lack of binoculars for lookouts, and insufficient lifeboats for all passengers, leading to massive loss of life.
